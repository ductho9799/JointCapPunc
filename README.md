# JointCapPunc: Vietnamese Capitalization and Punctuation Recovery Models

- We propose a joint model (namely, JointCapPunc) for capitalization and punctuation recorvering, that based on pretrained language model. 
- We also introduce the public capitalization and punctuation recovery dataset for Vietnamese.
